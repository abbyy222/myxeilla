This project is a React application that features a dynamic header component with interactive icons. A key feature is a modal that displays a functional calendar when the calendar icon in the header is clicked. This project was developed as an interview assessment, demonstrating core React concepts, state management, and modern CSS with Tailwind.
Features âœ¨
Responsive Header: A sleek, dark-themed header with multiple icons and a brand logo. It's designed to look great on various screen sizes.

Calendar Modal (CalendarModal.jsx): A dynamic calendar that allows users to navigate between months and years. It uses React's useState hook to manage the current date, programmatically generating the calendar grid. The modal's background features a modern, semi-transparent blur effect using Tailwind CSS's backdrop-blur utility, making the content behind it slightly visible.

Budget Modal (BudgetModal.jsx): This multi-section modal showcases a more complex UI layout. It has a dark top section with an SVG graphic and a distinct white bottom section containing a list of features and a "Create Budget" button. The modal is structured to accommodate different backgrounds and content within a single pop-up, demonstrating flexibility in component design.

SVG Component Integration: All icons and graphical elements within the application are handled as separate React SVG components. This approach ensures a scalable and organized codebase by avoiding large blocks of inline SVG code, making the components more readable and maintainable. This also allows the SVGs to be easily styled with CSS classes like any other React component.

State Management: Uses React's useState hook to manage the visibility of the modal, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Event Handling: Implements onClick handlers to toggle the modal's display and navigate the calendar. It also includes an onClose handler to close the modal by clicking outside of it, a common accessibility pattern.

Styling with Tailwind: The entire application is styled using Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach to a consistent, modern design.

Self-Contained Icons: All icons are implemented as inline SVG components, eliminating the need for external icon libraries like react-icons and avoiding potential build configuration issues.

During the development of this project, i faced several technical challenges that required careful debugging and problem-solving. Documenting these challenges highlights a key aspect of the development process:

1. SVG Import Issues
Initially, importing SVG files as React components using the import { ReactComponent as ... } from './icon.svg' syntax led to a SyntaxError. The development server would enter an infinite reload loop, indicating an issue with the build configuration.

Problem: The project's build tool (Vite) was not correctly configured to transform .svg files into React components, causing the import to fail.

Solution: We identified that the vite-plugin-svgr was the correct tool for this task. However, simply installing it wasn't enough. We had to ensure the plugin was correctly added to the plugins array in the vite.config.js file and that the project's Vite version was up-to-date.

2. Dependency Conflicts
Even after installing the correct plugin, we faced persistent errors.

Problem: The error logs showed that react-icons could not be resolved. This indicated a potential conflict or a missing package in the node_modules directory.

Solution: To resolve this, we made a crucial decision to completely remove the react-icons dependency. We converted all the icons from react-icons to inline SVG code. This not only fixed the build error but also improved performance by reducing the bundle size and eliminating an external dependency.

This project is a testament to the importance of meticulous debugging and understanding a project's underlying build process. By identifying and solving these challenges, we created a robust and efficient application that meets the assessment requirements.
